# DataStructures
My implementation of some of the well-known and commonly used Data Structures (eg BST, LinkedLists).


Each Data Structure folder contains four files organized as follows:

* [class.h]   -  Header file outlining the class contents and the functions supported.

* [class.cpp] -  Constructors and functions implementation.

* [main.cpp]  -  Helper file to test the class.

* [class.txt] -  Text file with detailed description of the class and the supported functions' parameters and Runtime.


Any enhancments suggestions or modificaitions are more than welcomed.
