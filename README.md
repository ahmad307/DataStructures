# DataStructures
My implementation of some of the well-known and commonly used Data Structures (eg BST, LinkedLists).




Each Data Structure folder contains four files organized as follows:

* [class.h] - file Outlining the class contents and the functions supported.

* [class.cpp] - Constructors and functions implementation.

* [main.cpp] - Helper file to test the class.

* [class.txt] - text file with detailed description of the class and the supported funcitons parameters and runtime.


Any enhancments suggestions or modificaitions are more than welcomed.
